This repo contains an exercise intended for Back-End Engineers.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repo.
1. Using technology of your choice, complete [the assignment](./Assignment.md).
1. Update this README with
    * a `How-To` section containing any instructions needed to execute your program.
    * an `Assumptions` section containing documentation on any assumptions made while interpreting the requirements.
1. Before the deadline, submit a pull request with your solution.

## Expectations
1. Please take no more than 8 hours to work on this exercise. Complete as much as possible and then submit your solution.
1. This exercise is meant to showcase how you work. With consideration to the time limit, do your best to treat it like a production system.

## How-To
1. Update within the Test.java file whereever the directories are to be created, for my program they have been created on my desktop.
2. You will need to install and add External JAR files that were implemented within this program. They are 
   jackson-databind, jackson-core, jackson-annotations. They can be downloaded from Jackson API Search website. 
3. Compile the Program and then execute.

## Assumptions
Tried my best to implement most of the requirements of the Assignment. However I was not able to get the JSON format exactly the same as
it was mentioned, but most of the program runs as it was supposed to.
